# Blocks-Project
The graphical user interface displays the blocks and allows the user to manipulate them. 

# About
The graphical user interface allows the user to interact through key presses and mouse clicks as 
outlined in this documentation. When the program runs, 20 blocks should be displayed on the 
screen (stored in a blocks list). You may use the starter code provided for you or code your own 
GUI.
